### Physical limitations

- 2 body physics (exception for Lagrange points)

### Scale

- "Solar" system at max

### Backdrop

- Simple, stable, consistent near-"Earth" orbital operations
    - competing space hotels
        - logistics of maintaining
            - hydrogen/other fuel (main body and/or asteroids, etc.)
            - Control transportation company?
                - space truckin' - launch company
                - Ship design?

##### Launch company evolution

1) Earth launch
2) Lunar/Lagrange refineries/factories, new tech, other habitats happen
    - Shifts steadily(?) from Earth-based to space-to-space
        - 100% resource delivery from Earth-to-space shifts to some ratio b/w

##### Seemingly interesting mechanics..

- Automate established launches/trajectories
    - User defines a general maneuver that can be replicated again and again

- Division of technological production capabilities
    - Basic habitation necessary goods a guarantee in space, e.g. general food
    - Complex goods, iPhone, Earth-based
- no need to have tech progression "in game" on the scale of such things as "Epstein drive"


- Resources have a space production cost and an Earth production cost, more or less
    - Commodities

##### Gamify this econ

- What can be made competitive?

- Possibility
    - Run a company that exists solely in space and possible refine in space
        - manage infrastructure in space b/w Lagrange and habitats, etc.
        - Compete w/ another industry that has more widespread capabilities
            - a company w/ Earth-based launch + space capabilities

##### mechanics

###### dont want

- "traditional" tech trees
    - at least one that's controlled (general background tech happening in the background makes sense)
        - avoid individual competitors navigating down each own's same-ish tech tree
        - fine for general tech of the civilization to be advancing and all/some companies potentially benefiting or having to adapt
            - Not to be rid entirely of intellectual property

###### want

- Variability in fuel sources
    - How various fuel sources play out in different settings, i.e. vacuum v Earth atmosphere + g
    - Source examples
        - hydrogen - advantage vacuum
            - complicated, expensive systems
        - methane - Mars


#### General route considerations

- Delta V required
- Fuel sources available
    - supply chain scenario
- engines available
- good being delivered
    - supply chain scenario


#### General thoughts

- Drone ships vs manned ships
    - cabin or no?
    - drone ships capable of higher g
