# Orbital
Orbital Unity sandbox

The work here is very dated! The project has migrated to the private Epicycle repo. Sorry for the inconvenience!
Build's will still be posted here on occasion.


## Notes

#### 06/18/2020

- Refactor of OrbitalMechanics script
  - Broken into subclasses in anticipation of general variable method

#### - Dated

- Fixed issue with maneuver nodes breaking while orbiting non-stationary bodies
- Fixed issue of maneuver nodes being placed inappropriately while on a hyperbolic trajectory
    - Note that this is about as imperfect as hyperbolic orbits generally are right now when approaching an asymptote
