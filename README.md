# Orbital
Orbital Unity sandbox

## Notes

#### 06/18/2020

- Refactor of OrbitalMechanics script
  - Broken into subclasses in anticipation of general variable method

#### - Dated

- Fixed issue with maneuver nodes breaking while orbiting non-stationary bodies
- Fixed issue of maneuver nodes being placed inappropriately while on a hyperbolic trajectory
    - Note that this is about as imperfect as hyperbolic orbits generally are right now when approaching an asymptote
